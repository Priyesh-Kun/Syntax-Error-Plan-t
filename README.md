# Syntax-Error-Plan!t

This is the app made by our team to enable students to decide their priorities and let them increase the productivity. This app includes daily tasks manager and it also enables them to create weeekly and monthly targets. But what makes our project unique is that we had enabled it to take the input for tasks through voice. We have also included a calculator. 

We ran into mulitple challenges at many points in development. For every team member it was first time developing an web application. The frontend section of team faced challenges in creating the css and js for html pages, while it was database and linking for backend section. Using django for developing the backend was a really challenging task. We nearly stuck at every code, but we finally managed to produce the final result with the help of stack overflow snippets and also with the help of our sdslab members who were there for the help of us. 

Here we dive into setting up the application
